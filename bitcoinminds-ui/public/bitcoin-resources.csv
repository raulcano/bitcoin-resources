It typically comes out of solution with the produced oil but in many cases it is simply leakage from pipe, valves, tanks or instrumentation. Some facilities have infrequent, small releases while some sites release gas up to and beyond regulated limits. Natural gas release is a particularly bad carbon emitter because it is mostly made of methane, which has 25 - 30 times the global warming potential than carbon dioxide per unit mass.",,,

Some bitcoins are mined with non-renewable energy, although plenty is mined with hydro, nuclear, or otherwise-vented natural gas, too.

Bitcoiners are rightfully frustrated at having to defend Bitcoin’s share of global energy production, given the lack of equivalent scrutiny applied to other apparently wasteful applications which consume similar amounts of energy.

One particular area at risk are cryptocurrencies, a market currently worth over 150 billion USD. We investigate the risk of Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, to attacks by quantum computers. We find that the proof-of-work used by Bitcoin is relatively resistant to substantial speedup by quantum computers in the next 10 years, mainly because specialized ASIC miners are extremely fast compared to the estimated clock speed of near-term quantum computers. On the other hand, the elliptic curve signature scheme used by Bitcoin is much more at risk, and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027, by the most optimistic estimates. We analyze an alternative proof-of-work called Momentum, based on finding collisions in a hash function, that is even more resistant to speedup by a quantum computer. We also review the available post-quantum signature schemes to see which one would best meet the security and efficiency requirements of blockchain applications. ",,,

They are everywhere, the thieves and their people. Masters of secrecy. Until now we have detected their presence only by what they leave behind. A body in a burned-out Audi. Workers riddled with bullets in the Kazakh Desert. A rigged election in Zimbabwe. A British banker silenced and humiliated for trying to expose the truth about the City of London. They have amassed more money than most countries. But what they are really stealing is power. In this real-life thriller packed with jaw-dropping revelations, award-winning investigative journalist Tom Burgis weaves together four stories that reveal a terrifying global web of corruption: the troublemaker from Basingstoke who stumbles on the secrets of a Swiss bank, the ex-Soviet billionaire constructing a private empire, the righteous Canadian lawyer with a mysterious client, and the Brooklyn crook protected by the CIA. Glimpses of this shadowy world have emerged over the years. In Kleptopia, Burgis connects the dots.

Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we�re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself. Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won�t make a search engine. Tomorrow�s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today�s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.

Family loyalty and responsibility, in men no less than in gibbons or beavers or robins, rests on joint attachment to a private territory. Morality - our willingness to make personal sacrifice for interests larger than ourselves - has its origins in dim evolutionary beginnings. Amid the resounding controversy surrounding African Genesis Ardrey published his second treatise. First published in 1966, The Territorial Imperative explores more deeply and incisively man�s evolutionary nature and threatens even more forcefully assumptions held dear. In a time when scientific dogma attributed to man either no instincts at all, or instincts too weak to be of significance, Ardrey�s conclusions raised an even greater storm.

In it, a saintly man, Prince Myshkin, is thrust into the heart of a society more concerned with wealth, power, and sexual conquest than with the ideals of Christianity. Myshkin soon finds himself at the center of a violent love triangle in which a notorious woman and a beautiful young girl become rivals for his affections. Extortion, scandal, and murder follow, testing Myshkin�s moral feelings, as Dostoevsky searches through the wreckage left by human misery to find �man in man.� The Idiot is a quintessentially Russian novel, one that penetrates the complex psyche of the Russian people. �They call me a psychologist,� wrote Dostoevsky. �That is not true.

Lacking the ability to measure their longitude, sailors throughout the great ages of exploration had been literally lost at sea as soon as they lost sight of land. Thousands of lives and the increasing fortunes of nations hung on a resolution. One man, John Harrison, in complete opposition to the scientific community, dared to imagine a mechanical solution-a clock that would keep precise time at sea, something no clock had ever been able to do on land. Longitude is the dramatic human story of an epic scientific quest and of Harrison's forty-year obsession with building his perfect timekeeper, known today as the chronometer. Full of heroism and chicanery, it is also a fascinating brief history of astronomy, navigation, and clockmaking, and opens a new window on our world.",,,

In this �artful, informative, and delightful� (William H. McNeill, New York Review of Books) book, a classic of our time, evolutionary biologist Jared Diamond dismantles racist theories of human history by revealing the environmental factors actually responsible for its broadest patterns. The story begins 13,000 years ago, when Stone Age hunter-gatherers constituted the entire human population. Around that time, the developmental paths of human societies on different continents began to diverge greatly. Early domestication of wild plants and animals in the Fertile Crescent, China, Mesoamerica, the Andes, and other areas gave peoples of those regions a head start at a new way of life. But the localized origins of farming and herding proved to be only part of the explanation for their differing fates. The unequal rates at which food production spread from those initial centers were influenced by other features of climate and geography, including the disparate sizes, locations, and even shapes of the continents. Only societies that moved away from the hunter-gatherer stage went on to develop writing, technology, government, and organized religions as well as deadly germs and potent weapons of war. It was those societies, adventuring on sea and land, that invaded others, decimating native inhabitants through slaughter and the spread of disease. A major landmark in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way in which the modern world, and its inequalities, came to be.",,,

Gwynne,"history, society","Although readers may be more familiar with the tribal names Apache and Sioux, it was in fact the legendary fighting ability of the Comanches that determined when the American West opened up. Comanche boys became adept bareback riders by age six; full Comanche braves were considered the best horsemen who ever rode. They were so masterful at war and so skillful with their arrows and lances that they stopped the northern drive of colonial Spain from Mexico and halted the French expansion westward from Louisiana. White settlers arriving in Texas from the eastern United States were surprised to find the frontier being rolled backward by Comanches incensed by the invasion of their tribal lands. The war with the Comanches lasted four decades, in effect holding up the development of the new American nation. Gwynne�s exhilarating account delivers a sweeping narrative that encompasses Spanish colonialism, the Civil War, the destruction of the buffalo herds, and the arrival of the railroads, and the amazing story of Cynthia Ann Parker and her son Quanah�a historical feast for anyone interested in how the United States came into being.

Today�s bitter recriminations and panic represent more than just fear of the future, they reflect a basic confusion about what is happening and the historical backstory that brought us to this moment. The true effects of populism, a shrinking middle class, and concentrated financial wealth are only just beginning to manifest themselves under the current administrations. The lessons of Stoller�s study will only grow more relevant as time passes.

We hear some myths and lies so frequently that they feel like truths: Civilization is humankind�s greatest accomplishment. Progress is undeniable. Count your blessings. You�re lucky to be alive here and now. Well, maybe we are and maybe we aren�t. Civilized to Death counters the idea that progress is inherently good, arguing that the �progress� defining our age is analogous to an advancing disease. Prehistoric life, of course, was not without serious dangers and disadvantages. Many babies died in infancy. A broken bone, infected wound, snakebite, or difficult pregnancy could be life-threatening. But ultimately, Ryan argues, were these pre-civilized dangers more murderous than modern scourges, such as car accidents, cancers, cardiovascular disease, and a technologically prolonged dying process? At a time when our ecology, our society, and our own sense of selves feels increasingly imperiled, an accurate understanding of our species� long prelude to civilization is vital to a clear sense of the ultimate value of civilization�and its costs.

More by accident than design, in Churchill�s view, England was drawn into the affairs of Egypt in the 1880s, for at the same historical moment that the English, under Lord Cromer, were granted virtually sovereign power to establish a sound government in Egypt and to stimulate its national economy, the Mahdi rebelled in the Egyptian suzerainty of Sudan. Violence and bloodshed ensued, and the English soon found themselves embroiled alongside their Egyptian ally in a bitter conflict with the fiercely nationalistic Mahdi�a conflict that culminated in the massacre of General Charles Gordon at Khartoum and the emergence of the fanatical regime known as the Dervish Empire. In this illuminating volume, Churchill not only dramatically relates the catastrophic events in Sudan�s 1880s, but also places them in the context of Sudanese history. So it is that his subsequent account of the reconquest and pacification of Sudan by a mixed Anglo-Egyptian force under the command of Sir Herbert Kitchener weds history to destiny, as the outcome of the River War for decades would link Great Britain to the uneasy future of Egypt and Sudan.",,,

From the Deep South to the Far West, to Yankeedom to El Norte, Woodard (author of American Character: A History of the Epic Struggle Between Individual Liberty and the Common Good) reveals how each region continues to uphold its distinguishing ideals and identities today, with results that can be seen in the composition of the U.S. Congress or on the county-by-county election maps of any hotly contested election in our history.",,,

In the market economy entrepreneurs are driven to serve consumers by their desire to earn profits and to avoid losses. In a bureaucracy, the managers must comply with orders issued by the legislative body under which they operate; they may not spend without authorization, and they may not deviate from the path prescribed by law. Ludwig von Mises here lucidly demonstrates how the efficiencies of private ownership and control of public good production ultimately trump the guesswork of publicly administered �planning� through codes and �officialdom.�",,,

But it's not just new communication technologies that have changed the world-it's access to them. Vernacular bibles gave rise to religious dissent, but it was only when the combination of cheaper paper and Gutenberg's printing press drove down the cost of books by 97 percent that the fuse of Reformation was lit. The Industrial Revolution allowed information to move faster and farther than ever before, though it concentrated power in the hands of those who ran radio and TV stations, large newspapers, and then, totalitarian governments.

In this stunningly original account of our evolutionary history, top scholars Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending reject this conventional wisdom and reveal that the human species has undergone a storm of genetic change much more recently. Human evolution in fact accelerated after civilization arose, they contend, and these ongoing changes have played a pivotal role in human history. They argue that biology explains the expansion of the Indo-Europeans, the European conquest of the Americas, and European Jews' rise to intellectual prominence. In each of these cases, the key was recent genetic change: adult milk tolerance in the early Indo-Europeans that allowed for a new way of life, increased disease resistance among the Europeans settling America, and new versions of neurological genes among European Jews. Ranging across subjects as diverse as human domestication, Neanderthal hybridization, and IQ tests, Cochran and Harpending's analysis demonstrates convincingly that human genetics have changed and can continue to change much more rapidly than scientists have previously believed.

There are powerful financial interests. There are desires for status and power. But most of all there is a desire among supposedly secular people for transcendence.

Dr Ostrom uses institutional analysis to explore different ways - both successful and unsuccessful - of governing the commons.

The author builds a persuasive case against ""development theory"" and imperialistic state planning that disregards the values, desires, and objections of its subjects. And in discussing these planning disasters, he identifies four conditions common to them all: the state's attempt to impose administrative order on nature and society; a high-modernist ideology that believes scientific intervention can improve every aspect of human life; a willingness to use authoritarian state power to effect large-scale innovations; and a prostrate civil society that cannot effectively resist such plans.",,,

Everything else can be made, bought or created. Our life is made up of around 600,000 hours and every second is of infinite value. We live in an attention economy where corporations are fighting for our time with the goal of monetizing our every second. The money we use loses value and devalues our time through inflation. When we work, we are exchanging our limited time for money whose quantity increases every year. It hasn�t always been this way. People used gold as money for a reason; it was also a limited resource. Now, what does the future hold? Valuing your time is the first step to improving your life. Knowing that your time is the only limited resource makes you more selective about the things you do, the people you spend your time with and the assets you choose to store your wealth in. Once you learn to appreciate your time, you will get busy doing the things you love and start making better financial choices.",,,

Jorg Guido Hulsmann shows that deflation is nothing to fear. The government should permit it to happen as a path to economic recovery and even as a tool to reform. Institutions that are liquidated in deflation need to be liquidated, and that includes banks and other financial institutions as well.The essay covers a surprisingly vast theoretical territory in a short space, including the nature of money and interest, the boom and bust, the impossibility of stabilization measures, and the economic trends of the recession.",,,

Bitcoin�s value has grown exponentially over multiple boom and bust cycles spanning a decade. Bitcoin is an Internet-native phenomenon like Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Microsoft, and Tencent. It therefore benefits from the �network effect� which makes it dramatically more valuable as the network grows. But its potential value is much larger than the giant Internet companies we know so well. If Bitcoin reaches that potential, its value could rise by 50 times its current price in the coming decade. This book will help you understand the role of money in our society, the current state of debt in our economy, and how Bitcoin provides a better solution.",,,

In contrast, The Not So Wild, Wild West casts America's frontier history in a new framework that emphasizes the creation of institutions, both formal and informal, that facilitated cooperation rather than conflict. Rather than describing the frontier as a place where heroes met villains, this book argues that everyday people helped carve out legal institutions that tamed the West. The authors emphasize that ownership of resources evolves as those resources become more valuable or as establishing property rights becomes less costly. Rules evolving at the local level will be more effective because local people have a greater stake in the outcome. This theory is brought to life in the colorful history of Indians, fur trappers, buffalo hunters, cattle drovers, homesteaders, and miners. The book concludes with a chapter that takes lessons from the American frontier and applies them to our modern ""frontiers""-the environment, developing countries, and space exploration.",,,

Yet there�s a black hole at the heart of biology. We do not know why complex life is the way it is, or, for that matter, how life first began. In The Vital Question, award-winning author and biochemist Nick Lane radically reframes evolutionary history, putting forward a solution to conundrums that have puzzled generations of scientists. For two and a half billion years, from the very origins of life, single-celled organisms such as bacteria evolved without changing their basic form. Then, on just one occasion in four billion years, they made the jump to complexity. All complex life, from mushrooms to man, shares puzzling features, such as sex, which are unknown in bacteria. How and why did this radical transformation happen? The answer, Lane argues, lies in energy: all life on Earth lives off a voltage with the strength of a lightning bolt. Building on the pillars of evolutionary theory, Lane�s hypothesis draws on cutting-edge research into the link between energy and cell biology, in order to deliver a compelling account of evolution from the very origins of life to the emergence of multicellular organisms, while offering deep insights into our own lives and deaths. Both rigorous and enchanting, The Vital Question provides a solution to life�s vital question: why are we as we are, and indeed, why are we here at all?",,,

Banker, man of letters, inventor of the Treasury bill, and author of Lombard Street, the still-canonical guide to stopping a run on the banks, Bagehot prescribed the doctrines that�decades later�inspired the radical responses to the world�s worst financial crises. Born in the small market town of Langport, just after the Panic of 1825 swept across England, Bagehot followed in his father�s footsteps and took a position at the local family bank�but his influence on financial matters would soon spread far beyond the county of Somerset. Persuasive and precocious, he came to hold sway in political circles, making high-profile friends, including William Gladstone�and enemies, such as Lord Overstone and Benjamin Disraeli. As a prolific essayist on wide-ranging topics, Bagehot won the admiration of Matthew Arnold and Woodrow Wilson, and delighted in paradox. He was also a misogynist, and while he opposed slavery, he misjudged Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War. As editor of the Economist, he offered astute commentary on the financial issues of his day, and his name lives on in an eponymous weekly column. He has been called ""the Greatest Victorian."" In James Grant�s colorful and groundbreaking biography, Bagehot appears as both an ornament to his own age and a muse to our own.

Juan Zarate, a chief architect of modern financial warfare and a former senior Treasury and White House official, pulls back the curtain on this shadowy world. In this gripping story, he explains in unprecedented detail how a small, dedicated group of officials redefined the Treasury's role and used its unique powers, relationships, and reputation to apply financial pressure against America's enemies. This group unleashed a new brand of financial power -- one that leveraged the private sector and banks directly to isolate rogues from the international financial system. By harnessing the forces of globalization and the centrality of the American market and dollar, Treasury developed a new way of undermining America's foes. Treasury and its tools soon became, and remain, critical in the most vital geopolitical challenges facing the United States, including terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and the regimes in Iran, North Korea, and Syria. This book is the definitive account, by an unparalleled expert, of how financial warfare has taken pride of place in American foreign policy and how America's competitors and enemies are now learning to use this type of power themselves. This is the unique story of the United States' financial war campaigns and the contours and uses of financial power, and of the warfare to come.",,,

Why? The popular answer has long been that U.S. banks have been under-regulated, that increased regulation and centralization over the years have helped, and that still more regulation and centralization is needed. In Money: Free and Unfree, George Selgin turns this conventional wisdom on its head. Through a series of painstakingly researched essays covering U.S. monetary history since before the Civil War, he traces U.S. financial disorders to their source in misguided government regulations. State governments were early culprits-but in taking advantage of the Civil War to dramatically increase its own involvement in the banking and currency system, the federal government set the stage for even worse problems to come. Instead of addressing the root causes of these crises, the Federal Reserve Act reinforced some of them, while dramatically increasing the potential for politically-motivated abuse of monetary policy.

The problem with this version of history? There�s not a shred of evidence to support it. Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom. He shows that for more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods�that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors. Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like �guilt,� �sin,� and �redemption�) derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. We are still fighting these battles today without knowing it.

All the while, technologists have hailed the underlying blockchain technology for these assets as potentially game changing applications for financial payments and record-keeping. At the same time, cryptoassets have produced considerable controversy. Many have turned out to be lacklustre investments for investors. Others, especially ICOs, have also attracted noticeable fraud, failing firms, and alarming lapses in information-sharing with investors. Consequently, many commentators around the world have pressed that ICO tokens be considered securities, and that concomitant registration and disclosure requirements attach to their sales to the public.

As inequality grows, the politics become more poisonous. Every year, more and more Americans go on shooting sprees, killing strangers and passers-by�and now, increasingly, representatives of the state. Troubling trends of this kind are endlessly discussed by public intellectuals and social scientists. But mostly, they talk about only a small slice of the overall problem. After all, how on earth can yet another murderous rampage have anything to do with polarization in Congress? And is there really a connection between too many multimillionaires and government gridlock? Historical analysis shows that long spells of equitable prosperity and internal peace are succeeded by protracted periods of inequity, increasing misery, and political instability. These crisis periods��Ages of Discord��have recurred in societies throughout history. Modern Americans may be disconcerted to learn that the US right now has much in common with the Antebellum 1850s and, more surprisingly, with ancien r�gime France on the eve of the French Revolution. Can it really be true that there is nothing new about our troubled time, and that similar ages arise periodically for similar underlying reasons? Ages of Discord marshals Structural-Demograpic Theory and detailed historical data to show that this is, indeed, the case. The book takes the reader on a roller-coaster ride through American history, from the Era of Good Feelings of the 1820s to our first Age of Discord, which culminated in the American Civil War, to post-WW2 prosperity and, finally, to our present, second Age of Discord.",,,

Expensive cigars, artworks, and jewels were routinely exchanged for staples such as bread; a cinema ticket could be bought for a lump of coal; and a bottle of paraffin for a silk shirt.

Money may no longer be physically printed and distributed in the voluminous quantities of 1923. However, ""quantitative easing,"" that modern euphemism for surreptitious deficit financing in an electronic era, can no less become an assault on monetary discipline.

We earn it, spend it and save it. We�re tempted to worship it and to trust it to provide for our needs. While much has been written about the power, danger, and stewardship of money, little has been written about what money actually is and whether or not money itself is moral. That information gap has been exploited to enrich a privileged few, enslave millions, and reap confusion and division throughout the world. How did this happen and what can we do about it? Thank God for Bitcoin explores the ways in which the current monetary system is broken and what can be done to fix it. It explores the creation of money, its corruption and its potential redemption. It looks at how Bitcoin is redeeming the ills of our corrupt monetary system and how the ongoing transition to sound money is a source of hope for a broken world.",,,

A fascinating intellectual journey through the history of communication and information, from the language of Africa�s talking drums to the invention of written alphabets; from the electronic transmission of code to the origins of information theory, into the new information age and the current deluge of news, tweets, images, and blogs.

Challenging leading scientific theories that claim that our senses report back objective reality, cognitive scientist Donald Hoffman argues that while we should take our perceptions seriously, we should not take them literally. How can it be possible that the world we see is not objective reality? And how can our senses be useful if they are not communicating the truth? Hoffman grapples with these questions and more over the course of this eye-opening work. Ever since Homo sapiens has walked the earth, natural selection has favored perception that hides the truth and guides us toward useful action, shaping our senses to keep us alive and reproducing. We observe a speeding car and do not walk in front of it; we see mold growing on bread and do not eat it. These impressions, though, are not objective reality. Just like a file icon on a desktop screen is a useful symbol rather than a genuine representation of what a computer file looks like, the objects we see every day are merely icons, allowing us to navigate the world safely and with ease. The real-world implications for this discovery are huge. From examining why fashion designers create clothes that give the illusion of a more �attractive� body shape to studying how companies use color to elicit specific emotions in consumers, and even dismantling the very notion that spacetime is objective reality, The Case Against Reality dares us to question everything we thought we knew about the world we see.",,,

This book by Gary North answers those views with chapter, verse, and an impressive account of the historical context for the Bible�s teachings on money, banking, commerce, and trade.Who knew that the Bible had so much to say about the issues of money and banking? The issue is a serious one because of the important history here and also because the Bible is such a foundational part of public understanding of every issue of public life and morality.You can search the libraries for weeks and not find a guide as good as Gary North's detailed account of every mention of money and banking in both the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures.What he finds underscores what the hard-money tradition has long said. Governments engage in evil when they change the definition of money. Inflation is a danger to the individual and society. Governments that monopolize the monetary system are abusing their power.

The very essence of American life, the dollar, is under attack. In a coordinated move by the rest of the world�s governments, the dollar loses all its value. The American President declares that the States will default on all its loans--prices skyrocket, currency becomes essentially worthless, and we watch one family struggle to survive through it all. The Mandibles can count on their inheritance no longer, and each member must come to terms with this in their own way-from the elegant ex-pat author Nollie, in her middle age, returning to the U.S. from Paris after many years abroad, to her precocious teenage nephew Willing, who is the only one to actually understand the crisis, to the brilliant Georgetown economics professor Lowell, who watches his whole vision of the world disintegrate before his eyes. As ever, in her new novel, Shriver draws larger than life characters who illuminate this complicated, ever-changing world. One of our sharpest observers of human nature, Shriver challenges us to think long and hard about the society we live in and what, ultimately, we hold most dear.",,,

294,1984-11-05,,Learning from Our Mistakes,book,https://www.amazon.de/dp/0313242399,en,Henry Perkinson,psychology,"This book focuses on the issue of mistakes in psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapy--the inevitability of making them, as far as possible how to avoid them, and what therapists can do to transform potential disasters into a means for growth in themselves as well as the patient. Further developing the creative therapeutic approach first elaborated in his classic Learning from the Patient, distinguished clinician and author Patrick Casement makes a compelling case for being open-minded rather than dogmatic in clinical practice. He shows how analysts can become blind to their own mistakes, and even more significantly, can fail to recognize when their efforts to guide or control the therapeutic process have become a problem for the patient. A wealth of evocative case material is used to illustrate how the process of internal supervision can facilitate heightened awareness of the patient's experience within the clinical encounter. Written with rare candor, this book challenges many traditional assumptions even as it affirms the healing power of psychodynamic work. It will be read with pleasure by practicing therapists as well as students and trainees.",,,

Aristotle said that philosophy begins with wonder, and the first Western philosophers developed theories of the world which express simultaneously their sense of wonder and their intuition that the world should be comprehensible. But their enterprise was by no means limited to this proto-scientific task. Through, for instance, Heraclitus' enigmatic sayings, the poetry of Parmenides and Empedocles, and Zeno's paradoxes, the Western world was introduced to metaphysics, rationalist theology, ethics, and logic, by thinkers who often seem to be mystics or shamans as much as philosophers or scientists in the modern mould. And out of the Sophists' reflections on human beings and their place in the world arose and interest in language, and in political, moral, and social philosophy. This volume contains a translation of all the most important fragments of the Presocratics and Sophists, and of the most informative testimonia from ancient sources, supplemented by lucid commentary.",,,

How does mere matter give rise to all these non-material mental states, including consciousness itself? An answer to this central question of our existence is emerging at the busy intersection of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence, and robotics. In this groundbreaking work, philosopher and cognitive scientist Andy Clark explores exciting new theories from these fields that reveal minds like ours to be prediction machines - devices that have evolved to anticipate the incoming streams of sensory stimulation before they arrive. These predictions then initiate actions that structure our worlds and alter the very things we need to engage and predict. Clark takes us on a journey in discovering the circular causal flows and the self-structuring of the environment that define ""the predictive brain."" What emerges is a bold, new, cutting-edge vision that reveals the brain as our driving force in the daily surf through the waves of sensory stimulation.",,,

At last, animals can build a free and just society in which the fruits of their labor belong entirely to them and in which everyone is equal.

Their bold prediction of disaster on Wall Street in Blood in the Streets was borne out by Black Tuesday.

peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.

The paper is available at:
http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

The main properties:
 Double-spending is prevented with a peer-to-peer network.
 No mint or other trusted parties.
 Participants can be anonymous.
 New coins are made from Hashcash style proof-of-work.
 The proof-of-work for new coin generation also powers the
    network to prevent double-spending.

Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

Abstract.  A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would
allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another
without the burdens of going through a financial institution.
Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted party is still required to prevent
double-spending.  We propose a solution to the double-spending
problem using a peer-to-peer network.  The network timestamps
transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based
proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without
redoing the proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as
proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came
from the largest pool of CPU power.  As long as honest nodes control
the most CPU power on the network, they can generate the longest
chain and outpace any attackers.  The network itself requires
minimal structure.  Messages are broadcasted on a best effort basis,
and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the
longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they
were gone.

We very, very much need such a system, but the way I understand your 
proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size.

For transferable proof of work tokens to have value, they must have 
monetary value.  To have monetary value, they must be transferred within 
a very large network - for example a file trading network akin to 
bittorrent.

To detect and reject a double spending event in a timely manner, one 
must have most past transactions of the coins in the transaction, which, 
  naively implemented, requires each peer to have most past 
transactions, or most past transactions that occurred recently. If 
hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions, that is a lot of 
bandwidth - each must know all, or a substantial part thereof.

Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.

The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.

But they don't.  Bad guys routinely control zombie farms of 100,000
machines or more.  People I know who run a blacklist of spam sending
zombies tell me they often see a million new zombies a day.

This is the same reason that hashcash can't work on today's Internet
-- the good guys have vastly less computational firepower than the bad
guys.

I also have my doubts about other issues, but this one is the killer.

Thanks for bringing up that point.

I didn't really make that statement as strong as I could have.  The requirement is that the good guys collectively have more CPU power than any single attacker. 

There would be many smaller zombie farms that are not big enough to overpower the network, and they could still make money by generating bitcoins.  The smaller farms are then the ""honest nodes"".  (I need a better term than ""honest"")  The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the higher the bar gets to overpower the network, making larger farms also too small to overpower it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too.  According to the ""long tail"" theory, the small, medium and merely large farms put together should add up to a lot more than the biggest zombie farm.

Even if a bad guy does overpower the network, it's not like he's instantly rich.  All he can accomplish is to take back money he himself spent, like bouncing a check.  To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a merchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to take his money back.  I don't think he could make as much money trying to pull a carding scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins.  With a zombie farm that big, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined.

The Bitcoin network might actually reduce spam by diverting zombie farms to generating bitcoins instead.

If I understand Simplified Payment Verification
correctly:

New coin issuers need to store all coins and all recent
coin transfers.

There are many new coin issuers, as many as want to be
issuers, but far more coin users.

Ordinary entities merely transfer coins.  To see if a
coin transfer is OK, they report it to one or more new
coin issuers and see if the new coin issuer accepts it.
New coin issuers check transfers of old coins so that
their new coins have valid form, and they report the
outcome of this check so that people will report their
transfers to the new coin issuer.

If someone double spends a coin, and one expenditure is
reported to one new coin issuer, and the other
simultaneously reported to another new coin issuer, then
both issuers to swifly agree on a unique sequence order
of payments.  This, however, is a non trivial problem of
a massively distributed massive database, a notoriously
tricky problem, for which there are at present no peer
to peer solutions.  Obiously it is a solvable problem,
people solve it all the time, but not an easy problem.
People fail to solve it rather more frequently.

  But let us suppose that the coin issue network is
dominated by a small number of issuers as seems likely.

If a small number of entities are issuing new coins,
this is more resistant to state attack that with a
single issuer, but the government regularly attacks
financial networks, with the financial collapse ensuing
from the most recent attack still under way as I write
this.

Government sponsored enterprises enter the business, in
due course bad behavior is made mandatory, and the evil
financial network is bigger than the honest financial
network, with the result that even though everyone knows
what is happening, people continue to use the paper
issued by the evil financial network, because of network
effects - the big, main issuers, are the issuers you use
if you want to do business.

Then knowledgeable people complain that the evil
financial network is heading for disaster, that the
government sponsored enterprises are about to cause a
""collapse of the total financial system"", as Wallison
and Alan Greenspan complained in 2005, the government
debates shrinking the evil government sponsored
enterprises, as with ""S. 190 [109th]: Federal Housing
Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005"" but they find
easy money too seductive, and S. 190 goes down in flames
before a horde of political activists chanting that easy
money is sound, and opposing it is racist, nazi,
ignorant, and generally hateful, the recent S. 190
debate on limiting portfolios (bond issue supporting dud
mortgages) by government sponsored enterprises being a
perfect reprise of the debates on limiting the issue of
new assignats in the 1790s.

The big and easy government attacks on money target a
single central money issuer, as with the first of the
modern political attacks, the French Assignat of 1792,
but in the late nineteenth century political attacks on
financial networks began, as for example the Federal
reserve act of 1913, the goal always being to wind up
the network into a single too big to fail entity, and
they have been getting progressively bigger, more
serious, and more disastrous, as with the most recent
one.  Each attack is hugely successful, and after the
cataclysm that the attack causes the attackers are
hailed as saviors of the poor, the oppressed, and the
nation generally, and the blame for the the bad
consequences is dumped elsewhere, usually on Jews,
greedy bankers, speculators, etc, because such attacks
are difficult for ordinary people understand.  I have
trouble understanding your proposal - ordinary users
will be easily bamboozled by a government sponsored
security update.  Further, when the crisis hits, to
disagree with the line, to doubt that the regulators are
right, and the problem is the evil speculators, becomes
political suicide, as it did in America in 2007,
sometimes physical suicide, as in Weimar Germany.

Still, it is better, and more resistant to attack by
government sponsored enterprises, than anything I have
seen so far.

If there were a hundred or a thousand money issuers by
the time the government attacks, the kind of government
attacks on financial networks that we have recently seen
might well be more difficult.

But I think we need to concern ourselves with minimizing
the data and bandwidth required by money issuers - for
small coins, the protocol seems wasteful.  It would be
nice to have the full protocol for big coins, and some
shortcut for small coins wherein people trust account
based money for small amounts till they get wrapped up
into big coins.

The smaller the data storage and bandwidth required for
money issuers, the more resistant the system is the kind
of government attacks on financial networks that we have
recently seen.

I think the real issue with this system is the market 
for bitcoins.  

Computing proofs-of-work have no intrinsic value.  We 
can have a limited supply curve (although the ""currency"" 
is inflationary at about 35% as that's how much faster 
computers get annually) but there is no demand curve 
that intersects it at a positive price point.

I know the same (lack of intrinsic value) can be said of 
fiat currencies, but an artificial demand for fiat 
currencies is created by (among other things) taxation 
and legal-tender laws.  Also, even a fiat currency can 
be an inflation hedge against another fiat currency's 
higher rate of inflation.   But in the case of bitcoins 
the inflation rate of 35% is almost guaranteed by the 
technology, there are no supporting mechanisms for 
taxation, and no legal-tender laws.  People will not 
hold assets in this highly-inflationary currency if 
they can help it.

Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.

Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.

security on the assumption that the CPU power of honest participants
outweighs that of the attacker. It is a very modern notion that exploits
the power of the long tail. When Wikipedia started I never thought it
would work, but it has proven to be a great success for some of the
same reasons.

I also do think that there is potential value in a form of unforgeable
token whose production rate is predictable and can't be influenced
by corrupt parties. This would be more analogous to gold than to fiat
currencies. Nick Szabo wrote many years ago about what he called ""bit
gold""[1] and this could be an implementation of that concept. There have
also been proposals for building light-weight anonymous payment schemes on
top of heavy-weight non-anonymous systems, so Bitcoin could be leveraged
to allow for anonymity even beyond the mechanisms discussed in the paper.

Unfortunately I am having trouble fully understanding the system. The
paper describes key concepts and some data structures, but does not
clearly specify the various rules and verifications that the participants
in the system would have to follow.

In particular I don't understand exactly what verifications P2P nodes
perform when they receive new blocks from other nodes, and how they
handle transactions that have been broadcast to them. For example, it
is mentioned that if a broadcast transaction does not reach all nodes,
it is OK, as it will get into the block chain before long. How does this
happen - what if the node that creates the ""next"" block (the first node
to find the hashcash collision) did not hear about the transaction,
and then a few more blocks get added also by nodes that did not hear
about that transaction? Do all the nodes that did hear it keep that
transaction around, hoping to incorporate it into a block once they get
lucky enough to be the one which finds the next collision?

Or for example, what if a node is keeping two or more chains around as
it waits to see which grows fastest, and a block comes in for chain A
which would include a double-spend of a coin that is in chain B? Is that
checked for or not? (This might happen if someone double-spent and two
different sets of nodes heard about the two different transactions with
the same coin.)

This kind of data management, and the rules for handling all the packets
that are flowing around is largely missing from the paper.

I also don't understand exactly how double-spending, or cancelling
transactions, is accomplished by a superior attacker who is able to muster
more computing power than all the honest participants. I see that he can
create new blocks and add them to create the longest chain, but how can
he erase or add old transactions in the chain? As the attacker sends out
his new blocks, aren't there consistency checks which honest nodes can
perform, to make sure that nothing got erased? More explanation of this
attack would be helpful, in order to judge the gains to an attacker from
this, versus simply using his computing power to mint new coins honestly.

As far as the spending transactions, what checks does the recipient of a
coin have to perform? Does she need to go back through the coin's entire
history of transfers, and make sure that every transaction on the list is
indeed linked into the ""timestamp"" block chain? Or can she just do the
latest one? Do the timestamp nodes check transactions, making sure that
the previous transaction on a coin is in the chain, thereby enforcing
the rule that all transactions in the chain represent valid coins?

Sorry about all the questions, but as I said this does seem to be a
very promising and original idea, and I am looking forward to seeing
how the concept is further developed. It would be helpful to see a more
process oriented description of the idea, with concrete details of the
data structures for the various objects (coins, blocks, transactions),
the data which is included in messages, and algorithmic descriptions
of the procedures for handling the various events which would occur in
this system. You mentioned that you are working on an implementation,
but I think a more formal, text description of the system would be a
helpful next step.

Increasing hardware speed is handled: ""To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.""

As computers get faster and the total computing power applied to creating bitcoins increases, the difficulty increases proportionally to keep the total new production constant.  Thus, it is known in advance how many new bitcoins will be created every year in the future.

The fact that new coins are produced means the money supply increases by a planned amount, but this does not necessarily result in inflation.  If the supply of money increases at the same rate that the number of people using it increases, prices remain stable.  If it does not increase as fast as demand, there will be deflation and early holders of money will see its value increase.

Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate seems like the best formula.

Right, nodes keep transactions in their working set until they get into a block.  If a transaction reaches 90% of nodes, then each time a new block is found, it has a 90% chance of being in it.

That does not need to be checked for.  The transaction in whichever branch ends up getting ahead becomes the valid one, the other is invalid.  If someone tries to double spend like that, one and only one spend will always become valid, the others invalid.

Receivers of transactions will normally need to hold transactions for perhaps an hour or more to allow time for this kind of possibility to be resolved.  They can still re-spend the coins immediately, but they should wait before taking an action such as shipping goods.

The attacker isn't adding blocks to the end.  He has to go back and redo the block his transaction is in and all the blocks after it, as well as any new blocks the network keeps adding to the end while he's doing that.  He's rewriting history.  Once his branch is longer, it becomes the new valid one.

This touches on a key point.  Even though everyone present may see the shenanigans going on, there's no way to take advantage of that fact. 

It is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid one.  Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those who were not present of this.  We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and others that joined later and never saw what happened.  The CPU power proof-of-work vote must have the final say.  The only way for everyone to stay on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, no matter what.

The recipient just needs to verify it back to a depth that is sufficiently far back in the block chain, which will often only require a depth of 2 transactions.  All transactions before that can be discarded.

Right, exactly.  When a node receives a block, it checks the signatures of every transaction in it against previous transactions in blocks.  Blocks can only contain transactions that depend on valid transactions in previous blocks or the same block.  Transaction C could depend on transaction B in the same block and B depends on transaction A in an earlier block.

I appreciate your questions.  I actually did this kind of backwards.  I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper.  I think I will be able to release the code sooner than I could write a detailed spec.  You're already right about most of your assumptions where you filled in the blanks.

The proof-of-work chain is the solution to the synchronisation problem, and to knowing what the globally shared view is without having to trust anyone.

A transaction will quickly propagate throughout the network, so if two versions of the same transaction were reported at close to the same time, the one with the head start would have a big advantage in reaching many more nodes first.  Nodes will only accept the first one they see, refusing the second one to arrive, so the earlier transaction would have many more nodes working on incorporating it into the next proof-of-work.  In effect, each node votes for its viewpoint of which transaction it saw first by including it in its proof-of-work effort.

If the transactions did come at exactly the same time and there was an even split, it's a toss up based on which gets into a proof-of-work first, and that decides which is valid.

When a node finds a proof-of-work, the new block is propagated throughout the network and everyone adds it to the chain and starts working on the next block after it.  Any nodes that had the other transaction will stop trying to include it in a block, since it's now invalid according to the accepted chain.

The proof-of-work chain is itself self-evident proof that it came from the globally shared view.  Only the majority of the network together has enough CPU power to generate such a difficult chain of proof-of-work.  Any user, upon receiving the proof-of-work chain, can see what the majority of the network has approved.  Once a transaction is hashed into a link that's a few links back in the chain, it is firmly etched into the global history.

The trouble is, you are comparing with the Bankcard
network.

But a new currency cannot compete directly with an old,
because network effects favor the old.

You have to go where Bankcard does not go.

At present, file sharing works by barter for bits. This,
however requires the double coincidence of wants. People
only upload files they are downloading, and once the
download is complete, stop seeding. So only active
files, files that quite a lot of people want at the same
time, are available.

File sharing requires extremely cheap transactions,
several transactions per second per client, day in and
day out, with monthly transaction costs being very small
per client, so to support file sharing on bitcoins, we
will need a layer of account money on top of the
bitcoins, supporting transactions of a hundred
thousandth the size of the smallest coin, and to support
anonymity, chaumian money on top of the account money.

Let us call a bitcoin bank a bink.  The bitcoins stand
in the same relation to account money as gold stood in
the days of the gold standard.  The binks, not trusting
each other to be liquid when liquidity is most needed,
settle out any net discrepancies with each other by
moving bit coins around once every hundred thousand
seconds or so, so bitcoins do not change owners that
often,   Most transactions cancel out at the account
level.  The binks demand bitcoins of each other only
because they don't want to hold account money for too
long. So a relatively small amount of bitcoins
infrequently transacted can support a somewhat larger
amount of account money frequently transacted.

OK, suppose one node incorporates a bunch of
transactions in its proof of work, all of them honest
legitimate single spends and another node incorporates a
slightly different bunch of transactions in its proof of
work, all of them equally honest legitimate single
spends, and both proofs are generated at about the same
time.

What happens then?

This does not work - your proposal involves
complications I do not think you have thought through.

Furthermore, it cannot be made to work, as in the
proposed system the work of tracking who owns what coins
is paid for by seigniorage, which requires inflation.

This is not an intolerable flaw - predictable inflation
is less objectionable than inflation that gets jiggered
around from time to time to transfer wealth from one
voting block to another.

They both broadcast their blocks.  All nodes receive them and keep both, but only work on the one they received first.  We'll suppose exactly half received one first, half the other.  

In a short time, all the transactions will finish propagating so that everyone has the full set.  The nodes working on each side will be trying to add the transactions that are missing from their side.  When the next proof-of-work is found, whichever previous block that node was working on, that branch becomes longer and the tie is broken.  Whichever side it is, the new block will contain the other half of the transactions, so in either case, the branch will contain all transactions.  Even in the unlikely event that a split happened twice in a row, both sides of the second split would contain the full set of transactions anyway.

It's not a problem if transactions have to wait one or a few extra cycles to get into a block.

So what happened to the coin that lost the race?

On the one hand, we want people who make coins to be
motivated to keep and record all transactions, and
obtain an up to date record of all transactions in a
timely manner.  On the other hand, it is a bit harsh if
the guy who came second is likely to lose his coin.

Further, your description of events implies restrictions
on timing and coin generation - that the entire network
generates coins slowly compared to the time required for
news of a new coin to flood the network, otherwise the
chains diverge more and more, and no one ever knows
which chain is the winner.

You need to make these restrictions explicit, for
network flood time may well be quite slow.

Which implies that the new coin rate is slower.

We want spenders to have certainty that their
transaction is valid at the time it takes a spend to
flood the network, not at the time it takes for branch
races to be resolved.

At any given time, for example at 1 040 689 138 seconds
we can look back at the past and say:

 At 1 040 688 737 seconds, node 5 was *it*, and
 he incorporated all the coins he had discovered
 into the chain, and all the new transactions he
 knew about on top of the previous link

 At 1 040 688 792 seconds, node 2 was *it*, and
 he incorporated all the coins he had discovered
 into the chain, and all the new transactions he
 knew about into the chain on top of node 5's
 link.

 At 1 040 688 745 seconds, node 7 was *it*, and
 he incorporated all the coins he had discovered
 into the chain, and all the new transactions he
 knew about into the chain on top of node 2's
 link.

But no one can know who is *it* right now

So how does one know when to reveal one's coins?  One
solution is that one does not.  One incorporates a hash
of the coin secret whenever one thinks one might be
*it*, and after that hash is securely in the chain,
after one knows that one was *it* at the time, one can
then safely spend the coin that one has found, revealing
the secret.

This solution takes care of the coin revelation problem,
but does not solve the spend recording problem.  If one
node is ignoring all spends that it does not care about,
it suffers no adverse consequences.  We need a protocol
in which your prospects of becoming *it* also depend on
being seen by other nodes as having a reasonably up to
date and complete list of spends - which this protocol
is not, and your protocol is not either.

If you're having trouble with the inflation issue, it's easy to tweak it for transaction fees instead.  It's as simple as this: let the output value from any transaction be 1 cent less than the input value.  Either the client software automatically writes transactions for 1 cent more than the intended payment value, or it could come out of the payee's side.  The incentive value when a node finds a proof-of-work for a block could be the total of the fees in the block.

When there are multiple double-spent versions of the same transaction, one and only one will become valid.

The receiver of a payment must wait an hour or so before believing that it's valid.  The network will resolve any possible double-spend races by then.

The guy who received the double-spend that became invalid never thought he had it in the first place.  His software would have shown the transaction go from ""unconfirmed"" to ""invalid"".  If necessary, the UI can be made to hide transactions until they're sufficiently deep in the block chain.

Sorry if I didn't make that clear.  The target time between blocks will probably be 10 minutes.

Every block includes its creation time.  If the time is off by more than 36 hours, other nodes won't work on it.  If the timespan over the last 6*24*30 blocks is less than 15 days, blocks are being generated too fast and the proof-of-work difficulty doubles.  Everyone does the same calculation with the same chain data, so they all get the same result at the same link in the chain.

Instantant non-repudiability is not a feature, but it's still much faster than existing systems.  Paper cheques can bounce up to a week or two later.  Credit card transactions can be contested up to 60 to 180 days later.  Bitcoin transactions can be sufficiently irreversible in an hour or two.

With the transaction fee based incentive system I recently posted, nodes would have an incentive to include all the paying transactions they receive.

That is not the question I am asking.

It is not trust that worries me, it is how it is
possible to have a  a globally shared view even if
everyone is well behaved.

The process for arriving at a globally shared view of
who owns what bitgold coins is insufficiently specified.
Once specified, then we can start considering whether
everyone has incentives to behave correctly.

It is not sufficient that everyone knows X.  We also
need everyone to know that everyone knows X, and that
everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows X
- which, as in the Byzantine Generals problem, is the
classic hard problem of distributed data processing.

This problem becomes harder when X is quite possibly a
very large amount of data - agreement on who was the
owner of every bitgold coin at such and such a time.

And then on top of that we need everyone to have a
motive to behave in such a fashion that agreement
arises.  I cannot see that they have motive when I do
not know the behavior to be motivated.

You keep repeating your analysis of the system under
attack.  We cannot say how the system will behave under
attack until we know how the system is supposed to
behave when not under attack.

If there are a lot of transactions, it is hard to
efficiently discover the discrepancies between one
node's view and another node's view, and because new
transactions are always arriving, no two nodes will ever
have the same view, even if all nodes are honest, and
all reported transactions are correct and true single
spends.

We should be able to accomplish a system where two nodes
are likely to come to agreement as to who owned what
bitgold coins at some very recent past time, but it is
not simple to do so.

If one node constructs a hash that represents its
knowledge of who owned what bitgold coins at a
particular time, and another node wants to check that
hash, it is not simple to do it in such a way that
agreement is likely, and disagreement between honest
well behaved nodes is efficiently detected and
efficiently resolved.

And if we had a specification of how agreement is
generated, it is not obvious why the second node has
incentive to check that hash.

The system has to work in such a way that nodes can
easily and cheaply change their opinion about recent
transactions, so as to reach consensus, but in order to
provide finality and irreversibility, once consensus has
been reached, and then new stuff has be piled on top of
old consensus, in particular new bitgold has been piled
on top of old consensus, it then becomes extremely
difficult to go back and change what was decided.

Saying that is how it works, does not give us a method
to make it work that way.

You keep discussing attacks.  I find it hard to think
about response to attack when it is not clear to me what
normal behavior is in the case of good conduct by each
and every party.

Distributed databases are *hard* even when all the
databases perfectly follow the will of a single owner.
Messages get lost, links drop, syncrhonization delays
become abnormal, and entire machines go up in flames,
and the network as a whole has to take all this in its
stride.

Figuring out how to do this is hard, even in the
complete absence of attacks.  Then when we have figured
out how to handle all this, then come attacks.

I agree that the description is not completely clear on how these matters
are handled. Satoshi has suggested that releasing source code may be the
best way to clarify the design. As I have tried to work through details on
my own, it does appear that the rules become rather complicated and indeed
one needs at least a pseudo-code algorithm to specify the behavior. So
perhaps writing real code is not a bad way to go. I found that there is
a sourceforge project set up for bitgold, although it does not have any
code yet.

In answer to James' specific question, about what happens when different
nodes see different sets of transactions, due to imperfect broadcast, here
is how I understand it. Each node must be prepared to maintain potentially
several ""candidate"" block chains, each of which may eventually turn out
to become the longest one, the one which wins. Once a given block chain
becomes sufficiently longer than a competitor, the shorter one can be
deleted. This length differential is a parameter which depends on the
node's threat model for how much compute power an attacker can marshall,
in terms of the fraction of the ""honst"" P2P network's work capacity,
and is estimated in the paper. The idea is that once a chain gets far
enough behind the longest one, there is essentially no chance that it
can ever catch up.

In order to resolve the issue James raised, I think it is necessary
that nodes keep a separate pending-transaction list associated with
each candidate chain. This list would include all transactions the node
has received (via broadcast by the transactees) but which have not yet
been incorporated into that block chain. At any given time, the node is
working to extend the longest block chain, and the block it is working
to find a hash collision for will include all of the pending transactions
associated with that chain.

I think that this way, when a candidate chain is deleted because it
got too much shorter than the longest one, transactions in it are
not lost, but have continued to be present in the pending-transaction
list associated with the longest chain, in those nodes which heard the
original transaction broadcast. (I have also considered whether nodes
should add transactions to their pending-transaction list that they
learn about through blocks from other nodes, even if those blocks do
not end up making their way into the longest block chain; but I'm not
sure if that is necessary or helpful.)

Once these rules are clarified, more formal modeling will be helpful in
understanding the behavior of the network given imperfect reliability. For
example, if on average a fraction f of P2P nodes receive a given
transaction broadcast, then I think one would expect 1/f block-creation
times to elapse before the transaction appears in what is destined to
become the longest chain. One might also ask, given that the P2P network
broadcast is itself imperfectly reliable, how many candidate chains
must a given node keep track of at one time, on average? Or as James
raised earlier, if the network broadcast is reliable but depends on a
potentially slow flooding algorithm, how does that impact performance?

I am somewhat less worried about motivation. I'd be satisfied if the
system can meet the following criteria:

1. No single node operator, or small collection of node operators
which controls only a small fraction of overall network resources,
can effectively cheat, if other players are honest.

2. The long tail of node operators is sufficiently large that no small
collection of nodes can control more than a small fraction of overall
resources. (Here, the ""tail"" refers to a ranking based on amount of
resources controlled by each operator.)

3. The bitcoin system turns out to be socially useful and valuable, so
that node operators feel that they are making a beneficial contribution
to the world by their efforts (similar to the various ""@Home"" compute
projects where people volunteer their compute resources for good causes).

In this case it seems to me that simple altruism can suffice to keep the
network running properly.

A very good point, and a more complete specification is necessary in order
to understand how the network will respond to imperfections like this. I
am looking forward to seeing more detail emerge.

One thing I might mention is that in many ways bitcoin is two independent
ideas: a way of solving the kinds of problems James lists here, of
creating a globally consistent but decentralized database; and then using
it for a system similar to Wei Dai's b-money (which is referenced in the
paper) but transaction/coin based rather than account based. Solving the
global, massively decentralized database problem is arguably the harder
part, as James emphasizes. The use of proof-of-work as a tool for this
purpose is a novel idea well worth further review IMO.

The proof-of-work chain is a solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem.  I'll try to rephrase it in that context.

A number of Byzantine Generals each have a computer and want to attack the King's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a certain number of characters in length.  Once they stimulate the network to generate a packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and erase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble.  They only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack at the same time.

They don't particularly care when the attack will be, just that they all agree.  It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce a time, and whatever time is heard first will be the official attack time.  The problem is that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different attack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear the other first.

They use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem.  Once each general receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its hash.  The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10 minutes of them all working at once before one of them finds a solution.  Once one of the generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and everyone changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that proof-of-work in the hash they're working on.  If anyone was working on a different attack time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.

After two hours, one attack time should be hashed by a chain of 12 proofs-of-work.  Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time.  They had to all have seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it.  If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.

The proof-of-work chain is how all the synchronisation, distributed database and global view problems you've asked about are solved.

Fortunately, it's only necessary to keep a pending-transaction pool for the current best branch.  When a new block arrives for the best branch, ConnectBlock removes the block's transactions from the pending-tx pool.  If a different branch becomes longer, it calls DisconnectBlock on the main branch down to the fork, returning the block transactions to the pending-tx pool, and calls ConnectBlock on the new branch, sopping back up any transactions that were in both branches.  It's expected that reorgs like this would be rare and shallow.

With this optimisation, candidate branches are not really any burden.  They just sit on the disk and don't require attention unless they ever become the main chain.

Broadcasts will probably be almost completely reliable.  TCP transmissions are rarely ever dropped these days, and the broadcast protocol has a retry mechanism to get the data from other nodes after a while.  If broadcasts turn out to be slower in practice than expected, the target time between blocks may have to be increased to avoid wasting resources.  We want blocks to usually propagate in much less time than it takes to generate them, otherwise nodes would spend too much time working on obsolete blocks.

I'm planning to run an automated test with computers randomly sending payments to each other and randomly dropping packets.

It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly.  I'm better with code than with words though.

I'm filling in some operational details that aren't in the paper 
by supplementing what you wrote with what my own ""design sense"" 
tells me are critical missing bits or ""obvious"" methodologies for 
use.

First, people spend computer power creating a pool of coins to use 
as money.  Each coin is a proof-of-work meeting whatever criteria 
were in effect for money at the time it was created.  The time of 
creation (and therefore the criteria) is checkable later because 
people can see the emergence of this particular coin in the 
transaction chain and track it through all its ""consensus view"" 
spends.  (more later on coin creation tied to adding a link). 

When a coin is spent, the buyer and seller digitally sign a (blinded) 
transaction record, and broadcast it to a bunch of nodes whose purpose 
is keeping track of consensus regarding coin ownership.  If someone 
double spends, then the transaction record can be unblinded revealing 
the identity of the cheater.  This is done via a fairly standard cut-
and-choose algorithm where the buyer responds to several challenges 
with secret shares, and the seller then asks him to ""unblind"" and 
checks all but one, verifying that they do contain secret shares any 
two of which are sufficient to identify the buyer.  In this case the 
seller accepts the unblinded spend record as ""probably"" containing 
a valid secret share. 

The nodes keeping track of consensus regarding coin ownership are in 
a loop where they are all trying to ""add a link"" to the longest chain 
they've so far recieved.  They have a pool of reported transactions 
which they've not yet seen in a ""consensus"" signed chain.  I'm going 
to call this pool ""A"".  They attempt to add a link to the chain by
moving everything from pool A into a pool ""L"" and using a CPU-
intensive digital signature algorithm to sign the chain including 
the new block L.  This results in a chain extended by a block 
containing all the transaction records they had in pool L, plus 
the node's digital signature.  While they do this, new 
transaction records continue to arrive and go into pool A again 
for the next cycle of work. 

They may also recieve chains as long as the one they're trying to 
extend while they work, in which the last few ""links"" are links 
that are *not* in common with the chain on which they're working.
These they ignore.  (?  Do they ignore them?  Under what 
circumstances would these become necessary to ever look at again, 
bearing in mind that any longer chain based on them will include 
them?) 

But if they recieve a _longer_ chain while working, they 
immediately check all the transactions in the new links to make 
sure it contains no double spends and that the ""work factors"" of 
all new links are appropriate.  If it contains a double spend, 
then they create a ""transaction"" which is a proof of double 
spending, add it to their pool A, broadcast it, and continue work.  
If one of the ""new"" links has an inappropriate work factor (ie, 
someone didn't put enough CPU into it for it to be ""licit"" 
according to the rules) a new ""transaction"" which is a proof 
of the protocol violation by the link-creating node is created, 
broadcast, and added to pool A, and the chain is rejected.  In 
the case of no double spends and appropriate work factors for 
all links not yet seen, they accept the new chain as consensus. 

If the new chain is accepted, then they give up on adding their
current link, dump all the transactions from pool L back into pool 
A (along with transactions they've recieved or created since 
starting work), eliminate from pool A those transaction records 
which are already part of a link in the new chain, and start work 
again trying to extend the new chain. 

If they complete work on a chain extended with their new link, they 
broadcast it and immediately start work on another new link with 
all the transactions that have accumulated in pool A since they 
began work.  

Do I understand it correctly?




Biggest Technical Problem: 

Is there a mechanism to make sure that the ""chain"" does not consist 
solely of links added by just the 3 or 4 fastest nodes?  'Cause a 
broadcast transaction record could easily miss those 3 or 4 nodes 
and if it does, and those nodes continue to dominate the chain, the 
transaction might never get added.  

To remedy this, you need to either ensure provable propagation of
transactions, or vary the work factor for a node depending on how 
many links have been added since that node's most recent link.   

Unfortunately, both measures can be defeated by sock puppets.  
This is probably the worst problem with your protocol as it 
stands right now; you need some central point to control the 
identities (keys) of the nodes and prevent people from making 
new sock puppets. 

Provable propagation would mean that When Bob accepts a new chain 
from Alice, he needs to make sure that Alice has (or gets) all
transactions in his ""A"" and ""L"" pools.  He sends them, and 
Alice sends back a signed hash to prove she got them. Once 
Alice has recieved this block of transactions, if any subsequent 
chains including a link added by Alice do not include those 
transactions at or before that link, then Bob should be able to 
publish the block he sent Alice, along with her signature, in a
transaction as proof that Alice violated protocol.  Sock puppets 
defeat this because Alice just signs subsequent chains using a 
new key, pretending to be a different node. 

If we go with varying the work factor depending on how many new 
links there are,  then we're right back to domination by the 3 
or 4 fastest nodes, except now they're joined by 600 or so 
sock puppets which they use to avoid the work factor penalty. 

If we solve the sock-puppet issue, or accept that there's a central 
point controlling the generation of new keys, then generation of 
coins should be tied to the act of successfully adding a block to 
the ""consensus"" chain.  This is simple to do; creation of a coin 
is a transaction, it gets added along with all the other transactions 
in the block.  But you can only create one coin per link, and of 
course if your version of the chain isn't the one that gets accepted,
then in the ""accepted"" view you don't have the coin and can't spend 
it.  This gives the people maintaining the consensus database a 
reason to spend CPU cycles, especially since the variance in work 
factor by number of links added since their own last link (outlined
above) guarantees that everyone, not just the 3 or 4 fastest nodes,
occasionally gets the opportunity to create a coin.

Also, the work requirement for adding a link to the chain should 
vary (again exponentially) with the number of links added to that 
chain in the previous week, causing the rate of coin generation 
(and therefore inflation) to be strictly controlled.  

You need coin aggregation for this to scale.  There needs to be 
a ""provable"" transaction where someone retires ten single coins 
and creates a new coin with denomination ten, etc.  This is not 
too hard, using the same infrastructure you've already got; it 
simply becomes part of the chain, and when the chain is accepted
consensus, then everybody can see that it happened.

No challenges or secret shares.  A basic transaction is just what you see in the figure in section 2.  A signature (of the buyer) satisfying the public key of the previous transaction, and a new public key (of the seller) that must be satisfied to spend it the next time.

Right, if it's equal in length, ties are broken by keeping the earliest one received.

There's no need for reporting of ""proof of double spending"" like that.  If the same chain contains both spends, then the block is invalid and rejected.  

Same if a block didn't have enough proof-of-work.  That block is invalid and rejected.  There's no need to circulate a report about it.  Every node could see that and reject it before relaying it.

If there are two competing chains, each containing a different version of the same transaction, with one trying to give money to one person and the other trying to give the same money to someone else, resolving which of the spends is valid is what the whole proof-of-work chain is about.

We're not ""on the lookout"" for double spends to sound the alarm and catch the cheater.  We merely adjudicate which one of the spends is valid.  Receivers of transactions must wait a few blocks to make sure that resolution has had time to complete.  Would be cheaters can try and simultaneously double-spend all they want, and all they accomplish is that within a few blocks, one of the spends becomes valid and the others become invalid.  Any later double-spends are immediately rejected once there's already a spend in the main chain.  

Even if an earlier spend wasn't in the chain yet, if it was already in all the nodes' pools, then the second spend would be turned away by all those nodes that already have the first spend.

Right.  They also refresh whenever a new transaction comes in, so L pretty much contains everything in A all the time.

It's a Hashcash style SHA-256 proof-of-work (partial pre-image of zero), not a signature.

If you're thinking of it as a CPU-intensive digital signing, then you may be thinking of a race to finish a long operation first and the fastest always winning.

The proof-of-work is a Hashcash style SHA-256 collision finding.  It's a memoryless process where you do millions of hashes a second, with a small chance of finding one each time.  The 3 or 4 fastest nodes' dominance would only be proportional to their share of the total CPU power.  Anyone's chance of finding a solution at any time is proportional to their CPU power.

There will be transaction fees, so nodes will have an incentive to receive and include all the transactions they can.  Nodes will eventually be compensated by transaction fees alone when the total coins created hits the pre-determined ceiling.

Every transaction is one of these.  Section 9, Combining and Splitting Value.

Okay, that's surprising.  If you're not using buyer/seller 
identities, then you are not checking that a spend is being made 
by someone who actually is the owner of (on record as having 
recieved) the coin being spent.  

There are three categories of identity that are useful to 
think about.  Category one: public.  Real-world identities 
are a matter of record and attached to every transaction.  
Category two: Pseudonymous.  There are persistent ""identities"" 
within the system and people can see if something was done by 
the same nym that did something else, but there's not necessarily 
any way of linking the nyms with real-world identities.  Category 
three: unlinkably anonymous.  There is no concept of identity,
persistent or otherwise.  No one can say or prove whether the 
agents involved in any transaction are the same agents as involved 
in any other transaction. 

Are you claiming category 3 as you seem to be, or category 2?
Lots of people don't distinguish between anonymous and 
pseudonymous protocols, so it's worth asking exactly what 
you mean here.  

Anyway:  I'll proceed on the assumption that you meant very 
nearly (as nearly as I can imagine, anyway) what you said, 
unlinkably anonymous.  That means that instead of an ""identity"", 
a spender has to demonstrate knowledge of a secret known only 
to the real owner of the coin.  One way to do this would be 
to have the person recieving the coin generate an asymmetric 
key pair, and then have half of it published with the 
transaction.  In order to spend the coin later, s/he must 
demonstrate posession of the other half of the asymmetric 
key pair, probably by using it to sign the key provided by 
the new seller.  So we cannot prove anything about ""identity"", 
but we can prove that the spender of the coin is someone who 
knows a secret that the person who recieved the coin knows. 

And what you say next seems to confirm this: 

> No challenges or secret shares.  A basic transaction is just 
> what you see in the figure in section 2.  A signature (of the

Note, even though this doesn't involve identity per se, it still 
makes the agent doing the spend linkable to the agent who 
earlier recieved the coin, so these transactions are linkable.  
In order to counteract this, the owner of the coin needs to 
make a transaction, indistinguishable to others from any 
normal transaction, in which he creates a new key pair and 
transfers the coin to its posessor (ie, has one sock puppet 
""spend"" it to another). No change in real-world identity of 
the owner, but the transaction ""linkable"" to the agent who spent 
the coin is unlinked.  For category-three unlinkability, this 
has to be done a random number of times - maybe one to six 
times?  


BTW, could you please learn to use carriage returns??  Your 
lines are scrolling stupidly off to the right and I have to 
scroll to see what the heck you're saying, then edit to add 
carriage returns before I respond.

Mmmm.  I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.  You're saying 
there's no effort to identify and exclude nodes that don't 
cooperate?  I suspect this will lead to trouble and possible DOS 
attacks.

Okay, when you say ""same"" transaction, and you're talking about 
transactions that are obviously different, you mean a double 
spend, right?  Two transactions signed with the same key?

Until.... until what?  How does anybody know when a transaction 
has become irrevocable?   Is ""a few"" blocks three?  Thirty?  A 
hundred?  Does it depend on the number of nodes?  Is it logarithmic 
or linear in number of nodes?

But in the absence of identity, there's no downside to them 
if spends become invalid, if they've already recieved the 
goods they double-spent for (access to website, download, 
whatever).  The merchants are left holding the bag with 
""invalid"" coins, unless they wait that magical ""few blocks"" 
(and how can they know how many?) before treating the spender 
as having paid.  

The consumers won't do this if they spend their coin and it takes 
an hour to clear before they can do what they spent their coin on. 
The merchants won't do it if there's no way to charge back a 
customer when they find the that their coin is invalid because 
the customer has doublespent.

So there's a possibility of an early catch when the broadcasts of 
the initial simultaneous spends interfere with each other.  I assume 
here that the broadcasts are done by the sellers, since the buyer 
has a possible disincentive to broadly disseminate spends.

Okay, that's a big difference between a proof of work that takes 
a huge set number of CPU cycles and a proof of work that takes a 
tiny number of CPU cycles but has a tiny chance of success.  You 
can change the data set while working, and it doesn't mean you 
need to start over. This is good in this case, as it means nobody 
has to hold recently recieved transactions out of the link they're
working on.

Right.  That was the misconception I was working with.  Again, the 
difference between a proof taking a huge set number of CPU cycles 
and a proof that takes a tiny number of CPU cycles but has a tiny 
chance of success.

It's like a random variation in the work factor; in this way it works 
in your favor.

I don't understand how ""transaction fees"" would work, and how the money 
would find its way from the agents doing transactions to those running 
the network.  But the economic effect is the same (albeit somewhat 
randomized) if adding a link to the chain allows the node to create 
a coin, so I would stick with that.

Also, be aware that the compute power of different nodes can be 
expected to vary by two orders of magnitude at any given moment in 
history.

Right, it's ECC digital signatures.  A new key pair is used for every
transaction.

It's not pseudonymous in the sense of nyms identifying people, but it
is at least a little pseudonymous in that the next action on a coin
can be identified as being from the owner of that coin.

There is no reliance on identifying anyone.  As you've said, it's
futile and can be trivially defeated with sock puppets.

The credential that establishes someone as real is the ability to
supply CPU power.

Section 11 calculates the worst case under attack.  Typically, 5 or
10 blocks is enough for that.  If you're selling something that
doesn't merit a network-scale attack to steal it, in practice you
could cut it closer.

This is a version 2 problem that I believe can be solved fairly
satisfactorily for most applications.

The race is to spread your transaction on the network first.  Think 6
degrees of freedom -- it spreads exponentially.  It would only take
something like 2 minutes for a transaction to spread widely enough
that a competitor starting late would have little chance of grabbing
very many nodes before the first one is overtaking the whole network.
 During those 2 minutes, the merchant's nodes can be watching for a
double-spent transaction.  The double-spender would not be able to
blast his alternate transaction out to the world without the merchant
getting it, so he has to wait before starting.

If the real transaction reaches 90% and the double-spent tx reaches
10%, the double-spender only gets a 10% chance of not paying, and 90%
chance his money gets spent.  For almost any type of goods, that's
not going to be worth it for the scammer.

Information based goods like access to website or downloads are
non-fencible.  Nobody is going to be able to make a living off
stealing access to websites or downloads.  They can go to the file
sharing networks to steal that.  Most instant-access products aren't
going to have a huge incentive to steal. 

If a merchant actually has a problem with theft, they can make the
customer wait 2 minutes, or wait for something in e-mail, which many
already do.  If they really want to optimize, and it's a large
download, they could cancel the download in the middle if the
transaction comes back double-spent.  If it's website access,
typically it wouldn't be a big deal to let the customer have access
for 5 minutes and then cut off access if it's rejected.  Many such
sites have a free trial anyway.

This requires that we know, that is to say an honest
well behaved peer whose communications and data storage
is working well knows, what the current best branch is -
but of course, the problem is that we are trying to
discover, trying to converge upon, a best branch, which
is not easy at the best of times, and becomes harder
when another peer is lying about its connectivity and
capabilities, and yet another peer has just had a major
disk drive failure obfuscated by a software crash, and
the international fibers connecting yet a third peer
have been attacked by terrorists.

Which presupposes the branches exist, that they are
fully specified and complete.  If they exist as complete
works, rather than works in progress, then the problem
is already solved, for the problem is making progress.

 > Broadcasts will probably be almost completely
 > reliable.

There is a trade off between timeliness and reliability.
One can make a broadcast arbitrarily reliable if time is
of no consequence.  However, when one is talking of
distributed data, time is always of consequence, because
it is all about synchronization (that peers need to have
corresponding views at corresponding times) so when one
does distributed data processing, broadcasts are always
highly unreliable Attempts to ensure that each
message arrives at least once result in increased timing
variation. Thus one has to make a protocol that is
either UDP or somewhat UDP like, in that messages are
small, failure of messages to arrive is common, messages
can arrive in different order to the order in which they
were sent, and the same message may arrive multiple
times.  Either we have UDP, or we need to accommodate
the same problems as UDP has on top of TCP connections.

Rather than assuming that each message arrives at least
once, we have to make a mechanism such that the
information arrives even though conveyed by messages
that frequently fail to arrive.

 > TCP transmissions are rarely ever dropped these days

People always load connections near maximum.  When a
connection is near maximum, TCP connections suffer
frequent unreasonably long delays, and connections
simply fail a lot - your favorite web cartoon somehow
shows it is loading forever, and you try again, or it
comes up with a little x in place of a picture, and you
try again

Further very long connections - for example ftp
downloads of huge files,  seldom complete. If you try to
ftp a movie, you are unlikely to get anywhere unless
both client and server have a resume mechanism so that
they can talk about partially downloaded files.

UDP connections, for example Skype video calls, also
suffer frequent picture freezes, loss of quality, and so
forth, and have to have mechanisms to keep going
regardless.

No, it is very attractive to the libertarian if we can
design a mechanism that will scale to the point of
providing the benefits of rapidly irreversible payment,
immune to political interference, over the internet,
to very large numbers of people. You have an outline
and proposal for such a design, which is a big step
forward, but the devil is in the little details.

I really should provide a fleshed out version of your
proposal, rather than nagging you to fill out the blind
spots.

I mean a node only needs the pending-tx pool for the best branch it
has.  The branch that it currently thinks is the best branch.
That's the branch it'll be trying to make a block out of, which is
all it needs the pool for.

I think I've got the peer networking broadcast mechanism covered.  

Each node sends its neighbours an inventory list of hashes of the
new blocks and transactions it has.  The neighbours request the
items they don't have yet.  If the item never comes through after a
timeout, they request it from another neighbour that had it.  Since
all or most of the neighbours should eventually have each item,
even if the coms get fumbled up with one, they can get it from any
of the others, trying one at a time.

The inventory-request-data scheme introduces a little latency, but
it ultimately helps speed more by keeping extra data blocks off the
transmit queues and conserving bandwidth.

I believe I've worked through all those little details over the
last year and a half while coding it, and there were a lot of them.
The functional details are not covered in the paper, but the
sourcecode is coming soon.  I sent you the main files.

How do identities help?  It's supposed to be anonymous cash, right?  And
say you identify a double spender after the fact, then what?  Perhaps
you're looking at a disposable ID.  Or perhaps you can't chase them
down.

Double spend detection needs to be real-time or near real-time.

There are a number of significantly different ways this
could be implemented.  I have been working on my own
version based on Patricia hash trees, (not yet ready to
post, will post in a week or so) with the consensus
generation being a generalization of file sharing using
Merkle hash trees. Patricia hash trees where the high
order part of the Patricia key represents the high order
part of the time can be used to share data that evolves
in time.  The algorithm, if implemented by honest
correctly functioning peers, regularly generates
consensus hashes of the recent past - thereby addressing
the problem I have been complaining about - that we have
a mechanism to protect against consensus distortion by
dishonest or malfunctioning peers, which is useless
absent a definition of consensus generation by honest
and correctly functioning peers.

I don't think your blinding works.

If there is a public record of who owns what coin, we
have to generate a  public diff on changes in that
record, so the record will show that a coin belonged to
X, and soon thereafter belonged to Y.  I don't think
blinding can be made to work.  We can blind the
transaction details easily enough, by only making hashes
of the details public, (X paid Y for
49vR7xmwYcKXt9zwPJ943h9bHKC2pG68m) but that X paid Y is
going to be fairly obvious.

If when Joe spends a coin to me, then I have to have the
ability to ask ""Does Joe rightfully own this coin"", then
it is difficult to see how this can be implemented in a
distributed protocol without giving people the ability
to trawl through data detecting that Joe paid me.

To maintain a consensus on who owns what coins, who owns
what coins has to be public.

We can build a privacy layer on top of this - account
money and chaumian money based on bitgold coins, much as
the pre 1915 US banking system layered account money and
bank notes on top of gold coins, and indeed we have to
build a layer on top to bring the transaction cost down
to the level that supports agents performing micro
transactions, as needed for bandwidth control, file
sharing, and charging non white listed people to send us
communications.

So the entities on the public record are entities
functioning like pre 1915 banks - let us call them
binks, for post 1934 banks no longer function like that.

I am troubled that this involves frequent
retransmissions of data that is already mostly known.
Consensus and widely distributed beliefs about bitgold
ownership already involves significant cost.  Further,
each transmission of data is subject to data loss, which
can result in thrashing, with the risk that the
generation of consensus may slow below the rate of new
transactions.  We already have problems getting the cost
down to levels that support micro transactions by
software agents, which is the big unserved market -
bandwidth control, file sharing, and charging non white
listed people to send us communications.

To work as useful project, has to be as efficient as it
can be - hence my plan to use a Patricia hash tree
because it identifies and locate small discrepancies
between peers that are mostly in agreement already,
without them needing to transmit their complete data.

We also want to avoid very long hash chains that have to
be frequently checked in order to validate things.  Any
time a hash chain can potentially become enormously long
over time, we need to ensure that no one ever has to
rewalk the full length.  Chains that need to be
re-walked can only be permitted to grow as the log of
the total number of transactions - if they grow as the
log of the transactions in any one time period plus the
total number of time periods, we have a problem.

We need a protocol wherein to be a money tracking peer
(an entity that validates spends) you have to be
accepted by at least two existing peers who agree to
synchronize data with you - presumably through human
intervention by the owners of existing peers, and these
two human approved synchronization paths indirectly
connect you to the other peers in the network through
at least one graph cycle.

If peer X is only connected to the rest of the network
by one existing peer, peer Y, perhaps because X's
directly connecting peer has dropped out, then X is
demoted to a client, not a peer - any transactions X
submits are relabeled by Y as submitted to Y, not X, and
the time of submission (which forms part of the Patricia
key) is the time X submitted them to Y, not the time
they were submitted to X.

The algorithm must be able swiftly detect malfunctioning
peers, and automatically exclude them from the consensus
temporarily - which means that transactions submitted
through malfunctioning peers do not get included in the
consensus, therefore have to be resubmitted, and peers
may find themselves temporarily demoted to clients,
because one of the peers through which they were
formerly connected to the network has been dropped by
the consensus.

If a peer gets a lot of automatic temporary exclusions,
there may be human intervention by the owners of those
peers to which it exchanges data directly to permanently
drop them.

Since peers get accepted by human invite, they have
reputation to lose, therefore we can make the null
hypothesis (the primary Bayesian prior) honest intent,
valid data, but  unreliable data transmission - trust
with infrequent random verification.  Designing the
system on this basis considerably reduces processing
costs.

Recall that SET died on its ass in large part because
every transaction involved innumerable public key
operations.  Similarly, we have huge security flaws in
https because it has so many redundant public key
operations that web site designers try to minimize the
use of https to cover only those areas that truly need
it - and they always get the decision as to what truly
needs it subtly wrong.

Efficiency is critical, particularly as the part of the
market not yet served is the market for very low cost
transactions.

A central point will invite attack, will be attacked.

The problem with computer networked money is that the
past can so easily be revised, so nodes come under
pressure to adjust the past - ""I did not pay that""
swiftly becomes ""I should not have paid that"", which
requires arbitration, which is costly, and introduces
uncertainty, which is costly, and invites government
regulation, which is apt to be utterly ruinous and
wholly devastating.

For many purposes, reversal and arbitration is highly
desirable, but there is no way anyone can compete with
the arbitration provided by Visa and Mastercard, for
they have network effects on their side, and they do a
really good job of arbitration, at which they have vast
experience, accumulated skills, wisdom, and good repute.
So any new networked transaction system has to target
the demand for final and irreversible transactions.

The idea of a distributed network consensus is that one
has a lot of peers in a lot of jurisdictions, and once a
transaction has entered into the consensus, undoing it
is damn near impossible - one would have to pressure
most of the peers in most of the jurisdictions to agree,
and many of them don't even talk your language, and
those that do, will probably pretend that they do not.
So people will not even try.

To avoid pressure, the network has to avoid any central
point at which pressure can be applied.  Recall Nero's
wish that Rome had a single throat that he could cut. If
we provide them with such a throat, it will be cut.

Actually no.  It is however supposed to be pseudonymous,
so dinging someone's reputation still does not help
much.

Near real time means we have to use UDP or equivalent,
rather than TCP or equivalent, and we have to establish
an approximate consensus, not necessarily the final
consensus, not necessarily exact agreement, but close to
it, in a reasonably small number of round trips.

system that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending.
It's completely decentralized with no server or central authority.

See bitcoin.org for screenshots.

Download link:
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/bitcoin/bitcoin-0.1.0.rar

Windows only for now.  Open source C++ code is included.

- Unpack the files into a directory
- Run BITCOIN.EXE
- It automatically connects to other nodes

If you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections,
you'll really be helping the network a lot.  Port 8333 on your
firewall needs to be open to receive incoming connections.

The software is still alpha and experimental.  There's no guarantee
the system's state won't have to be restarted at some point if it
becomes necessary, although I've done everything I can to build in
extensibility and versioning.

You can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on
Options->Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks.  I made
the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so
for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to
generate coins in just a few hours.  It'll get a lot harder when
competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty.
Generated coins must wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be
spent.

There are two ways to send money.  If the recipient is online, you
can enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public
key and send the transaction with comments.  If the recipient is
not online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which
is a hash of their public key that they give you.  They'll receive
the transaction the next time they connect and get the block it's
in.  This method has the disadvantage that no comment information
is sent, and a bit of privacy may be lost if the address is used
multiple times, but it is a useful alternative if both users can't
be online at the same time or the recipient can't receive incoming
connections.

Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins.  It'll be distributed
to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half
every 4 years.

first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins
next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins
next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins
next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins
etc...

When that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if
needed.  It's based on open market competition, and there will
probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.

It's interesting that the system can be configured to only allow a
certain maximum number of coins ever to be generated. I guess the
idea is that the amount of work needed to generate a new coin will
become more difficult as time goes on.

One immediate problem with any new currency is how to value it. Even
ignoring the practical problem that virtually no one will accept it
at first, there is still a difficulty in coming up with a reasonable
argument in favor of a particular non-zero value for the coins.

As an amusing thought experiment, imagine that Bitcoin is successful and
becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world.  Then the
total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all
the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household
wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With
20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.

So the possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of compute
time may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 million
to 1! Even if the odds of Bitcoin succeeding to this degree are slim,
are they really 100 million to one against? Something to think about...

I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using
electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it
that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party
gets cold feet.

It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points,
donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult
sites.  Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications
for services that could almost be free but not quite.

It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail.  The send dialog is
resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
It's sent directly when it connects.  The recipient doubleclicks
on the transaction to see the full message.  If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website.  ""Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally.""

Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their
free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge
bitcoins for the trial.

It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.  If
enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling
prophecy.  Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many
applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a
website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.

In the modern world, no major government wants to allow untracable
international financial transactions above some fairly modest size
thresholds.  (The usual catch-phrases are things like ""laundering
drug money"", ""tax evasion"", and/or ""financing terrorist groups"".)
To this end, electronic financial transactions are currently monitored
by various governments & their agencies, and any but the smallest of
transactions now come with various ID requirements for the humans
on each end.

But if each machine in a million-node botnet sends 10 cents to a
randomly chosen machine in another botnet on the other side of the
world, you've just moved $100K, in a way that seems very hard to
trace.  To me, this means that no major government is likely to allow
Bitcoin in its present form to operate on a large scale.

I also worry about other ""domestic"" ways nasty people could exploit
a widespread Bitcoin deployment:
* Spammer botnets could burn through pay-per-send email filters
  trivially (as usual, the costs would fall on people other than the
  botnet herders & spammers).
* If each machine in a botnet sends 1 cent to a herder, that can add
  up to a significant amount of money.  In other words, Bitcoin would
  make botnet herding and the assorted malware industry even more
  profitable than it already is.

Is there something obvious I've missed?  Is there a clever aspect of
the design which prevents botnets from exploiting the system?  Is there
a way for every major government to monitor all Bitcoin transactions
to watch for botnet-to-botnet sending?

Certainly a valid point, and one which has been widely discussed in
the debates over the years about electronic cash. Bitcoin has a couple
of things going for it: one is that it is distributed, with no single
point of failure, no ""mint"", no company with officers that can be
subpoenaed and arrested and shut down. It is more like a P2P network,
and as we have seen, despite degrees of at least governmental distaste,
those are still around.

Bitcoin could also conceivably operate in a less anonymous mode, with
transfers being linked to individuals, rather than single-use keys. It
would still be useful to have a large scale, decentralized electronic
payment system.

It also might be possible to refactor and restructure Bitcoin to separate
out the key new idea, a decentralized, global, irreversible transaction
database. Such a functionality might be useful for other purposes. Once
it exists, using it to record monetary transfers would be a sort of side
effect and might be harder to shut down.

It's important to understand that the proof-of-work (POW) aspect of
Bitcoin is primarily oriented around ensuring the soundness of the
historical transaction database. Each Bitcoin data block records a set
of transactions, and includes a hash collision. Subsequent data blocks
have their own transactions, their own collisions, and also chain to
all earlier hashes.  The result is that once a block is ""buried"" under
enough new blocks, it is essentially certain (given the threat model,
namely that attackers cannot muster more than X% of the compute power
of legitimate node operators) that old transactions can't be reversed.

Creating new coins is indeed currently also being done by POW, but I
think that is seen as a temporary expedient, and in fact the current
software phases that out over several years. Hence worries about botnets
being able to manufacture large quantities of POW tokens are only a
temporary concern, in the context of Bitcoin.

There have been a number of discussions in the past about POW tokens as
anti spam measures, given the botnet threat. References are available from
""Proof-of-work system"" on Wikipedia. Analyses have yielded mixed results,
depending on the assumptions and system design.

If POW tokens do become useful, and especially if they become money,
machines will no longer sit idle. Users will expect their computers to
be earning them money (assuming the reward is greater than the cost to
operate). A computer whose earnings are being stolen by a botnet will
be more noticeable to its owner than is the case today, hence we might
expect that in that world, users will work harder to maintain their
computers and clean them of botnet infestations.

Countermeasures by botnet operators would include moderating their take,
perhaps only stealing 10% of the productive capacity of invaded computers,
so that their owners would be unlikely to notice. This kind of thinking
quickly degenerates into unreliable speculation, but it points out the
difficulties of analyzing the full ramifications of a world where POW
tokens are valuble.

Some people tell me that the 0wned machines are among the most secure on
the network because botnet operators work hard to keep others from
compromising ""their"" machines. I could see the operators moving toward
being legitimate security firms, protecting computers against compromise in
exchange for some of the proof of work (POW) money.

Another factor that would mitigate spam if POW tokens have value:
there would be a profit motive for people to set up massive
quantities of fake e-mail accounts to harvest POW tokens from
spam.  They'd essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with
automated mailboxes that collect their POW and don't read the
message.  The ratio of fake mailboxes to real people could become
too high for spam to be cost effective. 

The process has the potential to establish the POW token's value
in the first place, since spammers that don't have a botnet could
buy tokens from harvesters.  While the buying back would
temporarily let more spam through, it would only hasten the
self-defeating cycle leading to too many harvesters exploiting the
spammers.

Interestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has a form of
spam called ""dusting"".  Spammers send a tiny amount of gold dust
in order to put a spam message in the transaction's comment field.
 If the system let users configure the minimum payment they're
willing to receive, or at least the minimum that can have a
message with it, users could set how much they're willing to get
paid to receive spam.

It's interesting that the system can be configured to only allow a
certain maximum number of coins ever to be generated. I guess the
idea is that the amount of work needed to generate a new coin will
become more difficult as time goes on.

One immediate problem with any new currency is how to value it. Even
ignoring the practical problem that virtually no one will accept it
at first, there is still a difficulty in coming up with a reasonable
argument in favor of a particular non-zero value for the coins.

As an amusing thought experiment, imagine that Bitcoin is successful and
becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world.  Then the
total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all
the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household
wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With
20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.

So the possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of compute
time may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 million
to 1! Even if the odds of Bitcoin succeeding to this degree are slim,
are they really 100 million to one against? Something to think about...

All the problems I've been finding are in the code that
automatically finds and connects to other nodes, since I wasn't
able to test it in the wild until now.  There are many more ways
for connections to get screwed up on the real Internet.

Bugs fixed:
- Fixed various problems that were making it hard for new nodes to
see other nodes to connect to.
- If you're behind a firewall, it could only receive one
connection, and the second connection would constantly disconnect
and reconnect.

These problems are kind of screwing up the network and will get
worse as more users arrive, so please make sure to upgrade.

Bitcoin is a new electronic cash system that uses a peer-to-peer 
network to prevent double-spending.  It's completely decentralized
with no server or central authority.
 
You can find screenshots and the download link at:
http://www.bitcoin.org
 
Windows only for now.  Open source C++ code is included.

- Unpack the files into a directory
- Run BITCOIN.EXE
- It automatically connects to other nodes

If you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections,
you'll really be helping the network a lot.  Port 8333 on your
firewall needs to be open to receive incoming connections.

The software is still alpha and experimental.  There's no guarantee
the system's state won't have to be restarted at some point if it
becomes necessary, although I've done everything I can to build in
extensibility and versioning.

You can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on
Options->Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks.  I made
the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so
for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to
generate coins in just a few hours.  It'll get a lot harder when
competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty.
Generated coins must wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be
spent.

There are two ways to send money.  If the recipient is online, you
can enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public
key and send the transaction with comments.  If the recipient is
not online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which
is a hash of their public key that they give you.  They'll receive
the transaction the next time they connect and get the block it's
in.  This method has the disadvantage that no comment information
is sent, and a bit of privacy may be lost if the address is used
multiple times, but it is a useful alternative if both users can't
be online at the same time or the recipient can't receive incoming
connections.

Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins.  It'll be distributed
to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half
every 4 years.

first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins
next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins
next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins
next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins
etc...

When that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if
needed.  It's based on open market competition, and there will
probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.

connection issues.  0.1.3 fixed a problem where your node's
communications could go dead after a while.  The network is
running much more smoothly now with this version. 

If you've successfully generated a block, you've seen it has a
maturation countdown before you can spend it.  Once it matures,
the Credit column will change from 0.00 to 50.00.  For a block to
be valid, it has to be broadcasted to the network and get into the
block chain, which is why Generate does not run if you're not
connected.  If you generated a block without being connected, the
network wouldn't know about it and would continue building the
chain without it, leaving it behind, and the maturation countdown
would change to ""(not accepted)"" when your node sees that it
wasn't used.  If you subtract 1 from the status column, that's how
many blocks have been chained after yours.

I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using
electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it
that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party
gets cold feet.

It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points,
donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult
sites.  Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications
for services that could almost be free but not quite.

It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail.  The send dialog is
resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
It's sent directly when it connects.  The recipient doubleclicks
on the transaction to see the full message.  If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website.  ""Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally.""

Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their
free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge
bitcoins for the trial.

It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.  If
enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling
prophecy.  Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many
applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a
website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.

That sounds good. I'd also like to be able to run multiple coin/block
generators on multiple machines, all behind a single NAT address. I
haven't tried this yet so I don't know if it works on the current
software.

BTW I don't remember if we talked about this, but the other day some
people were mentioning secure timestamping. You want to be able to
prove that a certain document existed at a certain time in the past.
Seems to me that bitcoin's stack of blocks would be perfect for this.

Right, and I'd like to see more of a library interface that could be
called from programming or scripting languages, on the client side as
well.

The current version will work fine.  They'll each connect over the
Internet, while incoming connections only come to the host that
port 8333 is routed to. 

As an optimisation, I'll make a switch ""-connect=1.2.3.4"" to make
it only connect to a specific address.  You could make your extra
nodes connect to your primary, and only the primary connects over
the Internet.  It doesn't really matter for now, since the network
would have to get huge before the bandwidth is anything more than
trivial.

Indeed, Bitcoin is a distributed secure timestamp server for
transactions.  A few lines of code could create a transaction with
an extra hash in it of anything that needs to be timestamped.  
I should add a command to timestamp a file that way.

I haven't had any reports of crashes in v0.1.5.  It's been rock solid 
for me on Windows.  I think it must be Wine related.  If you get another 
crash in Wine and it prints anything on the terminal, e-mail me and I 
may be able to figure out what happened, maybe something I can work 
around.  Martti and I have been working on a new version to release soon 
and it would be nice to get any Wine fixes in there.

Those don't look like anything to worry about.  Probably functions 
unimplemented by Wine that are harmlessly stubbed out.

You can delete debug.log occasionally if you don't want to take the disk 
space.  It's just status messages that help with debugging.

That just means it failed to create a minidump, so yeah, not the cause of

To find the cause of the crash you'd need to run it with a +seh,+relay trace

838,2010-07-06,2021-07-15,[bitcoin-list] Bitcoin 0.3 released! (2010-07-06 21:53:53),other,https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/25686730/,en,Satoshi Nakamoto,"bitcoin-list, satoshi, email","Announcing version 0.3 of Bitcoin, the P2P cryptocurrency!  Bitcoin is a 
digital currency using cryptography and a distributed network to replace 
the need for a trusted central server.  Escape the arbitrary inflation 
risk of centrally managed currencies!  Bitcoin's total circulation is 
limited to 21 million coins.  The coins are gradually released to the 
network's nodes based on the CPU power they contribute, so you can get a 
share of them by contributing your idle CPU time.

What's new:
- Command line and JSON-RPC control
- Includes a daemon version without GUI
- Transaction filter tabs
- 20% faster hashing
- Hashmeter performance display
- Mac OS X version (thanks to Laszlo)
- German, Dutch and Italian translations (thanks to DataWraith, Xunie 
and Joozero)

Get it at http://www.bitcoin.org, and read the forum to find out more.

We enhance this approach in two dimensions. Firstly, we take into account the probability of a payment actually being possible due to the unknown balance distributions in the channels. Secondly, we use minimum cost flows as a proper generalization of shortest paths to multi-part payments (MPP). In particular we show that under plausible assumptions about the balance distributions we can find the most likely MPP for any given set of senders, recipients and amounts by solving for a (generalized) integer minimum cost flow with a separable and convex cost function. Polynomial time exact algorithms as well as approximations are known for this optimization problem. We present a round-based algorithm of min-cost flow computations for delivering large payment amounts over the Lightning Network. This algorithm works by updating the probability distributions with the information gained from both successful and unsuccessful paths on prior rounds. In all our experiments a single digit number of rounds sufficed to deliver payments of sizes that were close to the total local balance of the sender. Early experiments indicate that our approach increases the size of payments that can be reliably delivered by several orders of magnitude compared to the current state of the art. We observe that finding the cheapest multi-part payments is an NP-hard problem considering the current fee structure and propose dropping the base fee to make it a linear min-cost flow problem. Finally, we discuss possibilities for maximizing the probability while at the same time minimizing the fees of a flow. While this turns out to be a hard problem in general as well - even in the single path case - it appears to be surprisingly tractable in practice.",,lightning2.jpg,

We evaluate the method by running an analysis based on data collected by our monitor nodes and compare the data to a ground-truth based on few peers that we run ourselves. The node degree of public peers is found with high precision and Sybil peers are correctly classified with very high precision and high recall if the spamming peers and the monitor are connected to all Sybil addresses,,privacy.jpg,

It consists of combining the math behind finite fields and elliptic curves to create one way equations, meaning you can choose your private key (some number) and easily calculate your public key (some other number). However, I can’t take my public key (or anybody else’s for that matter) and easily calculate their private key. In fact, for Bitcoin it would take trillions of computers trillions of years of continuous guessing of different private keys to figure out which one creates a given public key.",,privacy2.jpg,

In its current version, in spite of the hype, bitcoin failed to satisfy the notion of ""currency without government"" (it proved to not even be a currency at all), can be neither a short nor long term store of value (its expected value is no higher than 0), cannot operate as a reliable inflation hedge, and, worst of all, does not constitute, not even remotely, a safe haven for one’s investments, a shield against government tyranny, or a tail protection vehicle for catastrophic episodes. Furthermore, bitcoin promoters appear to conflate the success of a payment mechanism (as a decentralized mode of exchange), which so far has failed, with the speculative variations in the price of a zero-sum maximally fragile asset with massive negative externalities. Going through monetary history, we show how a true numeraire must be one of minimum variance with respect to an arbitrary basket of goods and services, how gold and silver lost their inflation hedge status during the Hunt brothers squeeze in the late 1970s and what would be required from a true inflation hedged store of value.",,puppet.jpg,
