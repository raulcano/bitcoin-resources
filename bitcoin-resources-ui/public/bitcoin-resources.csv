This certainly sounds alarming — but the reality is a little more complicated. The author discusses several common misconceptions surrounding the Bitcoin sustainability debate, and ultimately argues that it’s up to the crypto community to acknowledge and address environmental concerns, work in good faith to reduce Bitcoin’s carbon footprint, and ultimately demonstrate that the societal value that Bitcoin provides is worth the resources needed to sustain it.",

It typically comes out of solution with the produced oil but in many cases it is simply leakage from pipe, valves, tanks or instrumentation. Some facilities have infrequent, small releases while some sites release gas up to and beyond regulated limits. Natural gas release is a particularly bad carbon emitter because it is mostly made of methane, which has 25 - 30 times the global warming potential than carbon dioxide per unit mass.",

These data centers tend to be located in places with inexpensive electricity, often where hydroelectricity is plentiful, like Washington State in the U.S. But how much electricity is consumed by these miners? Knowing this helps us to better understand the economics and financial opportunities of Bitcoin mining. Previous estimates have not been very accurate, often making simplistic assumptions.

Some bitcoins are mined with non-renewable energy, although plenty is mined with hydro, nuclear, or otherwise-vented natural gas, too. No one contests the externality of bitcoin, although the precise carbon footprint is debated. However, the article, by opinion columnist Lionel Laurent unfortunately relies on the flawed assumption that individual bitcoin transactions carry an energy overhead.",

Bitcoiners are rightfully frustrated at having to defend Bitcoin’s share of global energy production, given the lack of equivalent scrutiny applied to other apparently wasteful applications which consume similar amounts of energy. In a sense, arguing over minutiae like the energy mix of bitcoin miners, as I have done in the past, is to miss the point.
