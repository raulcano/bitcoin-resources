This certainly sounds alarming — but the reality is a little more complicated. The author discusses several common misconceptions surrounding the Bitcoin sustainability debate, and ultimately argues that it’s up to the crypto community to acknowledge and address environmental concerns, work in good faith to reduce Bitcoin’s carbon footprint, and ultimately demonstrate that the societal value that Bitcoin provides is worth the resources needed to sustain it.",

It typically comes out of solution with the produced oil but in many cases it is simply leakage from pipe, valves, tanks or instrumentation. Some facilities have infrequent, small releases while some sites release gas up to and beyond regulated limits. Natural gas release is a particularly bad carbon emitter because it is mostly made of methane, which has 25 - 30 times the global warming potential than carbon dioxide per unit mass.",

These data centers tend to be located in places with inexpensive electricity, often where hydroelectricity is plentiful, like Washington State in the U.S. But how much electricity is consumed by these miners? Knowing this helps us to better understand the economics and financial opportunities of Bitcoin mining. Previous estimates have not been very accurate, often making simplistic assumptions. So I decided to conduct the most exhaustive research on this topic that I could.",

Casey","mining, energy"," am frustrated by the debate over whether or not bitcoin is an environmental disaster waiting to happen. No one seems to know what assumptions to use. Depending on what efficiency ratios we assume for currently operating ASIC mining rigs, they’re either consuming 35 terawatt-hours per year, the equivalent of Denmark, or something far less, closer perhaps to Bolivia. The stinginess of mining pools to provide information about their operations can be partly blamed for this.",

Bitcoin creates its double-spend barrier by compelling the attacker to replace the branch of the targeted transaction with one of probabilistically greater work. Interestingly, such a replacement raises the barrier to subsequent attackers. The energy expended is not independently important, the erected barrier is the attacker's necessary financial burden.",
